# Video Quality Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to enhance video quality on the origin page (InfiniteMenu component).

## Changes Made

### 1. Increased Texture Resolution
- **Before**: 512x512 pixel cells for video textures
- **After**: 1024x1024 pixel cells for higher resolution
- **Impact**: Significantly improved visual quality of videos in the WebGL sphere

### 2. Enhanced Video Loading
- Added `preload="auto"` for faster video loading
- Added `playsInline` and webkit-specific attributes for mobile compatibility
- Improved error handling and retry logic for video playback
- Added high-quality image rendering styles

### 3. Improved WebGL Texture Filtering
- **Before**: Basic LINEAR filtering
- **After**: LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR for better quality at different distances
- Added mipmap generation for smoother scaling
- Enhanced canvas context with high-quality settings

### 4. Better Video Context Settings
```javascript
this.videoCtx = this.videoCanvas.getContext('2d', {
  alpha: false,
  willReadFrequently: false,
  desynchronized: true
});
this.videoCtx.imageSmoothingEnabled = true;
this.videoCtx.imageSmoothingQuality = 'high';
```

### 5. CSS Optimizations
- Added hardware acceleration (`transform: translateZ(0)`)
- Optimized image rendering with multiple fallback options
- Added `will-change` property for performance
- Improved video masking and object-fit properties

### 6. ProjectDetail Component Improvements
- Enhanced video player with high-quality rendering
- Better controls and autoplay handling
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

## Video File Optimization Script

A video optimization script (`optimize_videos.sh`) has been created to:
- Convert large .mov files to optimized .mp4 format
- Reduce file sizes while maintaining quality
- Use web-optimized encoding settings
- Generate multiple quality versions if needed

### Usage
```bash
chmod +x optimize_videos.sh
./optimize_videos.sh
```

## Performance Impact

### Positive
- Higher quality video rendering
- Better scaling and mipmapping
- Improved mobile compatibility
- Hardware acceleration

### Considerations
- Slightly increased memory usage due to larger textures
- Initial loading may take slightly longer for high-quality videos

## Browser Compatibility

The improvements are compatible with:
- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 55+
- Safari 11+
- Edge 79+

## Recommendations

1. **Optimize Video Files**: Run the optimization script to convert large .mov files to web-optimized .mp4
2. **Monitor Performance**: Check for any performance issues on lower-end devices
3. **Consider Progressive Loading**: For very large videos, consider implementing progressive loading
4. **CDN Integration**: Consider using a CDN for faster video delivery
